Where to get started?
1) What do we need to make a game engine?
	- data model, game logic, assets, ect...

2) What have other game engines done?
	- unity, unreal, entt, etc...

3) What do we want out of the api?
	- ref other engines, talks, etc...

4) What should our design look like?
	- put together a uml diagram, outline design decisions

5) Slap it together, document it well!
	- document and refactor previously written code (good luck figuring it out)

6) Show it in a demo and wrap it in a build system (cmake probably)
